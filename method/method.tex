\section{Molecules}
Degrees of freedom

\subsection{Interaction Potentials}
Intermolecular - LJ potential from each atom
Intramolecular - harmonic potential between atoms, large potential to model rigid atoms
Constraints due to software

\section{Lammps}
Freely available software
Molecular dynamics
Noose-Hoover thermostating


\subsection{Rahman-Parinello}
Allowing simulation cell to adjust to shape of crystal

\section{Crystal Structures}
Toby's structures
Converting to large unit cell, squaring the edges
The starting unit cells

\section{Melting Points}
Heat up slowly until melting
More points around melting

\section{Interface Kinetics}
Region of liquid, region of crystal. Liquid created by holding the crystal region in place and heating the liquid above melting point.
