\chapter{Structure}

In the previous chapter we investigated the dynamics of three molecular systems; \sone, \scon and \tri. The dynamics properties of these systems remained smooth throughout the range we simulated them, indicating that there was no phase transition taking place. While there is no obvious phase transition, one possible cause of the increasing time scales for the dynamics properties is the growth of crystal regions within the simulations.

The goal of this chapter is to investigate the structural properties of the three systems studied in the previous chapter; the \sone, \scon and \tri to determine whether the dynamic properties observed are purely dynamic properties or can be attributed to structural properties of the system.

\section{Is there Crystal Formation}

Over the course of the simulations to determine the dynamic properties of the system it is possible that the system transitioned from the purely amorphous phase to a structure that was a mixture of crystalline and amorphous regions. If these regions are long lived, rather than just fluctuations, as the temperature is dropped these regions are only more likely to grow; the lower entropy crystal phase is more favourable at low temperatures. Using this reasoning we can use the final configuration as an indication of the formation of crystalline regions over the entire temperature range of the simulation. From this final configuration we can take an inherent structure, removing any of the vibrational noise giving a configuration that is representative of the mean arrangement of the molecules. These arrangements are shown in \textfigref{inherent structures frame} where the colour of each molecule is given by its orientation.

While there appears to be no long range ordering in these configurations, to make a definitive statement we need more specialised tools. One of the alternate forms that could form is a plastic-crystal, a form where the position of the molecules is ordered while their orientations are disordered. This form can be more easily discerned by removing the orientational representation of the molecules, instead representing the center of mass of each molecule as a dot~\figref{inherent structures com}. This focuses the search for order, the centers of mass lining up over long ranges would be indicative of this plasti-crystal order.

While the techniques to find crystalline ordering have been non-specialised, we do not know what the crystal looks like. Knowing the structure of the crystal beforehand allows an enhancement of our tools to look specifically for the expected structure.

\section{What Crystals would Form}

In the interests of developing more specialised tools for detecting crystalline order, we need to understand the crystal structures that are likely to form. This involves finding the structures that we believe to be the lowest in energy. To find these lowest energy structures we need tools other than molecular dynamics since the timescales for molecular dynamics are beyond the limits of our simulations. To find a good approximation of the lowest energy structures we look to packing hard shapes, by modelling our molecules as hard shapes we are able to use an isopointal algorithm to get a good approximation of the closest packed configurations. These closest packed configurations were then used as the starting configuration for a Lennard-Jones system.

\end{table}

Knowing the crystal does help however there are other complications. For the \scon molecule the lowest energy state is degenerate. The bonds between the contacting particles can be arranged randomly with no change in energy, however there is an entropy change, with the random arrangement having more entropy than the ordered arrangement. The degeneracy of the \scon crystal state means that to detect crystalline order instead of looking at orientation and position instead we need to be focused on the centers of density, i.e. each particle individually.

\section{Order Parameters}


Rather than dealing with each molecule as at the start of this chapter we are now exploring order parameters of each individual particle, rather than each molecule.

One simple order parameter is to take the radial distribution function and apply it to each particle. Using each particle is going to be much closer to something seen in a x-ray defractometer as it is focused on center of density, rather than center of mass. These function still display the short range order...


We can also look at other properties of each particle, like the number of neighbours.

With the techniques that we possess we are unable to find any significant crystalline order in the system. There are small regions which show order, a result expected for a distribution of all possible arrangements, however these small regions are static, not displaying an important aspect of a crystal; growth.
