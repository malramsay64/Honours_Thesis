\chapter{Ordering in Inherent Structures}

The dynamic properties of the systems studied remained smooth and well behaved throughout the range we simulated them indicating that no phase transition took place over the range of temperatures. While the dynamics show no presence of a phase transition further study of the structure is necessary to rule out the possibility of ordering as a contributing factor in the slowing down of the dynamics. To remove the noise of vibrations from the structural analysis all the analysis in this chapter will be performed using inherent structures.


\section{The Lowest Energy Crystal Phases}

In the interests of developing more specialised tools for detecting crystalline order, we need to know which crystal structures are likely to form. In most cases finding the crystal structure that is likely to form is a case of finding the lowest energy crystal structure. To find these lowest energy structures we need tools other than molecular dynamics since we chose systems to have crystallisation timescales at or beyond the limits of our simulations. To find a good approximation of the lowest energy structures we look to packing hard shapes, by modelling our molecules as hard discs we are able to use an isopointal algorithm to get a good approximation of the closest packed configurations. These closest packed configurations can be used as the starting configuration for our system to be equilibrated at a low temperature allowing the crystals to relax into their lowest energy state before finding the inherent structure. \texttabref{crystal energies} shows the energy of the Lennard Jones systems that we are studying using the best packed isopointal structures for each wallpaper group as the starting configuration. Our Lennard-Jones system does not retain the constraints of the wallpaper group symmetry, however there are no significant deviations in the structure from that of the wallpaper group.

    \label{tab:crystal energies}
\end{table}

With the \tri molecule having three crystal forms with similar energies further analysis needs to be performed to elucidate the crystal structure that will actually form. Because the energies are so close together this moves from a search of structures to looking at the dynamics of crystal formation (full discussion on these systems in \textsecref{two phase}). For the \tri molecule in a system with a liquid-crystal boundary we observed a solid state rearrangement from the initial p2gg structure~\figref{tri rearr init} to bands of p2 structure~\figref{tri rearr fine} which tells us that the p2 structure is more stable than the p2gg structure and is likely the preferred of the three structures.

\begin{figure}

    \end{subfigure}
\caption{These configurations of the \tri molecule below the melting point show the solid-state phase transition that takes place.}
    \label{fig:tri two phase}
\end{figure}

Similarly the three lowest energy crystal structures for the \done molecules were also simulated using a two phase system. Just like the \tri molecue the p2gg crystal of the \done molecule also a exhibited a solid state phase transition from the p2gg to the p2 crystal, however both the p2gg and p2 crystals of the \done molecules had a lower melting point than the lowest energy \done crystal, p2mg. The high melting point of the p2mg crystal in the \done system compared to the other crystal structures tells us that the p2mg structure is the most likely crystal to form. With the \dcon molecule only the p2 and p2gg structure were tested as these had energies far below that of any other crystal structure. In this case the p2 structure had the highest melting point for the \dcon molecule.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Melting points of the crystal phases established from two phase systems}
    \label{tab:melting}
\end{table}

The lowest energy crystal structures we have determined for out molecules~\figref{crystals} consist of p2 and p2mg wallpaper groups. The p2 wallpaper group is the most heavily populated of the wallpaper groups, however the p2mg group is reasonably rare~\tocite. What all the crystal structures have in abundance is inversion centers between molecules, a result that supports the observations of ~\tocite.

Having worked out the crystal structures that are most likely to form for our molecules~\figref{crystals}, the properties of these crystal structures can be used to identify structures in the liquid phase that may indicate the presence of ordering.

\subsection{Order Parameters}

Taking what we know about the crystal structures we can develop order parameters which will aid in identifying regions of crystalline order. Along with crystalline order we also want to be able to identify other types of ordering including alignment of layers as would be found in a plastic-crystal. These more general forms of ordering form the basis of the more specific techniques.

The radial distribution function $G(r)$ is one of the more general techniques for measuring for detecting ordering in a simulated system. It is a measure of the distances between molecules over a number of shells. The radial distribution of the \done molecule~\figref{done radial} shows an intense first shell peak, the immediate neighbours are at well defined distances. Out to 12 units distance the \done molecule exhibits broad peaks showing the presence of some weak medium-range ordering. The \dcon molecule~\figref{dcon radial} exhibits an intense first peak and some sharp secondary and second shell peaks. The intensity and sharpness of these peaks can be attributed to the interactions of the \dcon molecules as the concavity. The \dcon molecule has the largest concavity of the three molecules and when molecules are in the concavity they are highly constrained giving tight distributions of the center of mass~\figref{dcon radial part}. Unlike the sharp peaks of the \dcon molecule the \tri molecule~\figref{tri radial} has a series of three broad peaks in the first shell of neighbours, with order only extending to three broad peaks in the second shell. It is likely the dual concavity of the \tri molecule is much less selective than the concavities of the Dimers.

    \label{fig:scon radial2d_abs}
\end{figure}

Another measure of order is to look at the orientational distribution of the molecules. This provides an alternate look at the degree to which molecules are organising over large distances. The angular distribution looks at whether there are some directions which molecules are favouring. None of the molecules~\figref{angular distributions} are showing a directional preference, a sign that there is no orientational ordering taking place.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Angular distributions of the three molecules show no orientational ordering.}
    \label{fig:angular distributions}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Order in \scon}

Both of the previous methods of describing order use properties of the molecule, its orientation and center of mass. In molecular systems these properties can be different than the underlying structure. Consider the compact binary packing with a size ration of 1:0.637556~\figref{compact}; this is equivalent to packing the \scon molecule without the allocation of bonds. The allocation of bonds can be performed randomly with no adjustment to the structure of the underlying particles. Two examples of assigning bonds; an ordered p2 structure~\figref{ordered frame}, and a randomly oriented structure~\figref{random frame} demonstrate the issues that a random assignment of bonds produces. The orientational order of the p2 structure can easily be seen with diagonal banding of colours, corresponding to the two orientations present in the structure. The randomly assigned structure has molecules arranged with no orientational order, distributed between the eight possible molecular orientations. We can attempt to remove the noise of this orientational disorder by only plotting the centers of mass~(\textfigref{ordered com} and~\textfigref{random com}), however this gives a very similar result, the ordered structure exhibits distinctly crystalline behaviour with centers of mass aligning in rows while the random structure that needs further analysis to be considered ordered.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{compact}
    \caption{The compact packing of discs with ratio 1:0.637556. Assignment of bonds to this structure can be performed randomly (top left) with no alteration of the underlying structure.}
    \label{fig:compact}
\end{figure}

The radial distribution function and the orientational ordering both use properties of the molecule. In the randomly oriented configuration the molecules are a construct on the ordered arrangement of particles. As the particles define the order, using an order parameter that is a measure of the ordering of the particles rather than the molecules is more appropriate in this case. If we define the \emph{particle radial distribution function} $G_p(r)$ in the same way as the radial distribution function, however instead of centers of mass we use the centers of density, the center of each disc. This particle radial distribution function translates better to experiments which look at the centers of density, rather than centers of mass.

    \caption{Comparison of the \scon molecule with crystalline p2 ordering (left column) and random assignment of bonds (right column).}
    \label{fig:compact bonds}
\end{figure}


Using this particle radial distribution function we can look for order in the inherent structures of the molecules. The \dcon molecule~\figref{dcon radial part} shows medium range ordering which was not present on the radial distribution function~\figref{dcon radial}. The particle radial distribution function has also helped in reducing the number of secondary peaks with much sharper and higher intensity peaks. The \done molecule~\figref{done radial part} shows no medium range ordering unlike when using the radial distribution~\figref{done radial} which is an example of the specificity of the ordering of these molecules. For order parameters to work effectively they have to be tailored to the particular molecule rather than being used generally.

\section{Locality of Order}

We have the radial distribution functions and the orientational order parameters that inform us of order in the bulk. However these order parameters do not provide information on where the order is located, how many molecules are in these areas, whether there is a single crystal or is polycrystalline, and the size of any regions of order. To take a local approach to order we have to find new order parameters that are capable of defining local order.

For the \done molecule we can define a local order parameter $O_\sone$ based on the p2mg crystal structure as
\begin{equation}
    O_{\sone} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{neigh}}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\text{neigh}} (\vect{\hat e} \cdot \vect{\hat e_i})^2
\end{equation}
where $N_\text{neigh}$ is the number of neighbours, $\vect{\hat e}$ is the unit orientation vector of the molecule and $\vect{\hat e_i}$ is the unit orientation vector of each neighbour. Molecules that are above a cutoff of $0.8$ are considered to be crystalline while molecules below this cutoff are amorphous. \textfigref{sone inherent} demonstrates this order parameter using the inherent structure of the \done molecule studied throughout this chapter. There are many small regions of crystalline order while most of the configuration is amorphous.

Defining a local order parameter for the \dcon molecules we can use the particle approach that worked well for the global order parameter, however in this case we are looking at the local environment of each particle. In the p2 crystalline structure each small particle has one other small neighbour and four large neighbours, and each large particle has three small and three large neighbours. Molecules with particles that have these specific neighbours are considered ordered.

The \tri molecule we are treating in the same way as the \sone molecule, using the local orientational order of each molecule to assess the degree of ordering. For the \tri molecule the cutoff for this function was determined to be 0.8, giving good differentiation between the crystal and liquid phases with a reasonable level of false positives and false negatives.
