\begin{itemize}

    \item Manipulating the formation of a condensed phase a critical part of both nature and technology. From molluscs that control the crystal formation of calcium carbonate, pharmaceutical companies forming molecular glasses to increase the solubility of drugs, to Apple controlling the formation of sapphire glass to put in its iphones.

    \item The glassy state is a crucial part of modern technology. Many of the materials that we rely on, plastics, optical fibres, silicon in photovoltaic cells, the display of your smartphone and the drugs you might take. However we are yet to fully understand and control the transition to this glassy state. Most of these processes involve navigating the supercooled regime where the slower dynamics tend to bypass crystallisation leading to dynamical arrest.

    \item A full understanding of this process not only needs to include the processes for forming a glass but also those to form a liquid. This comprehensive approach will help us better understand the features that are better suited for either glass or crystal formation. Molecules are the favoured approach since topology is a variable that can be easily changed and is suspected to be heavily involved in glass formation.

    \item As our devices become smaller and smaller the need to understand the processes forming them becomes more important. From growing single crystals with complete control to forming amorphous solids by completely avoiding the crystal phase. This requires an understanding of the interactions between the liquid and the crystal or amorphous glassy phases.

\section{Molecular Liquids}
The liquid phase is the most prevalent on Earth, from the liquid water in our oceans, to the liquid magma beneath the crust, it plays an important role in keeping us alive, but was also just as important in our evolutionary history.

The liquid phase can be characterised by its near incompressibility, and its ability to flow. One of the key properties of a liquid is its viscosity ($\eta$), which is measured in poise (\si{\poise}). Water has a viscosity in the range of \SI{e-2}{\poise}, and honey \SI{2}{\poise}. Using the Stokes-Einstein equation
\begin{equation}
    D=\frac{k_B T}{\eta\,C\,a}
\end{equation}
where $C$ and $a$ are constants for the interaction and surface area~\tocheck of particles respectively, we have a relation between the diffusion constant $D$ and the viscosity~\tocite. This relation is important to understanding the dynamics of the system.

The liquid phase exists due to an attractive force that extends far enough~\figref{fig:potentials}\tofix{figure reference format} for a particles to move past one another while still feeling the potential~\cite{tejero:94}. When the potential well becomes too narrow the liquid phase ceases to exist leaving only the solid and gas phases.

\begin{figure}
    \todofigure{Potentials, short and long range}
    \label{fig:potentials}
    \caption{Short range potential ($\sigma < 1.60$) compared to a long range potential ($\sigma > 1.60$)}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Structure}
The structure of the liquid is defined by this attractive force, with particles forming distinct shells~\figref{fig:radial distribution}. These shells however decay over distance, leaving an isotropic distribution. The \emph{radial distribution function} $g(r)$ is the distribution of particles found at a distance $r$ from any other particle,
\begin{align}
    g(r) &= \frac{1}{\rho} \langle \delta(r - r_i) \rangle
\end{align}
where $\rho = \frac{N}{V}$, the number density. The radial distribution function is a factor that when multiplied by the bulk density $\rho$ we get a local density $\rho(r) = \rho g(r)$. This means we can integrate over all space,
\begin{equation}
    \int_0^\infty \rho g(r) 4 \pi r^2\,dr = N-1 \approx N
\end{equation}
and get the total number of particles in the system.

The radial distribution function is also crucial in comparing simulation to experiment. By performing a Fourier transformation on $g(r)$
\begin{equation}
    S(q) = 1 + 4\pi\,\rho \int^\infty_0 \d r\,r^2 \frac{\sin{qr}}{qr} (g(r)-1)
\end{equation}
we get the static structure factor $S(q)$~\cite{allen:87,hansen:86} which can be experimentally determined by inelastic neutron scattering~\tocite or x-ray diffraction~\tocite.

Form well defined shells of nearest neighbours~\cite[p2]{barrat:03}

    \label{fig:radial distribution}
    \caption{We can see the short range order which after a few shells decays to an isotropic distribution.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamics}
The motion of particles in a liquid over a long time period is characterised by an uncorrelated random walk. Brownian motion which assumes that the path taken by an atom is to be random and irregular is in many cases a good theoretical description of diffusion in a liquid. The mathematical description of Brownian motion uses the \emph{Langevin equation};
\begin{equation}
    \ddiff{\vect u}{t} = - \zeta \vect u + \vect A(t)
\end{equation}
There are two parts to this equation, the frictional force ($\zeta$) generating the drag of the particle in the medium. There is also the stochastic fluctuating force ($A(t)$) which arises from the frequent collisions of particles in the liquid phase.

This can be solved~\cite{mcquarrie:76} by looking at the ensemble averages of the motion, giving two results. When the time $t$ is very small we get;
\begin{equation}
    \langle | \vect r - \vect{r_0}|^2 \rangle \rightarrow |u_0^2|t^2,   t \rightarrow 0
\end{equation}
while on large time scales we have a different result;
\begin{equation}
    \langle | \vect r - \vect{r_0} | \rangle = \frac{6kT}{m\zeta} t = 6Dt
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the diffusion constant $D = kT/m\zeta$. From this to get a meaningful measure of the diffusion constant we need to look at timescales that are long compared to $\zeta^{-1}$.

\section{Supercooled Liquids}

Intrinsically there is nothing to differentiate a liquid from a supercooled liquid, the difference comes from their relationship to the melting point. Liquids are the liquid phase when the temperature is above the melting point, supercooled liquids have a temperature below the melting point. The process of supercooling a liquid is an integral part of forming the solid phase, spontaneous crystallisation takes a long time to occur at the melting point due to the large surface area of any nucleus~\figref{fig:supercool crys}.

\begin{figure}
    \todofigure{Rate of crystallisation as a function of temperature}
    \caption{There is a supercooling that gives maximum rate of crystal formation}
    \label{fig:supercool crys}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Thermodynamics}

If looking at thermodynamics alone the supercooled liquid state should never exist, a liquid will always spontaneously crystallise at $T_m$. While this is not the case there are other ways that thermodynamics can yield more useful information about the supercooled state. Looking at entropy~\figref{fig:entropy} the liquid phase has a greater heat capacity than the crystal, resulting in a greater temperature dependence on entropy.~\cite{debenedetti:01}.

\begin{figure}
    \todofigure{Temperature dependence of enthalpy or volume}
    \caption{Entropy as a function of temperature}
    \label{fig:entropy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamics}

Over much of the temperature range of a liquid the viscosity ($\eta$) observes Arrhenius behaviour
\begin{equation}
    \eta = \eta_0 \e^{(E/k_bT)}
\end{equation}
however in in supercooled molecular liquids we can get deviation from this~\figref{fig:angell}. Glass formers which stick to the Arrhenius temperature dependence are considered strong glass formers, with molten \ce{SiO2} being an archetypal example. Those that exhibit super-arrhenius behaviour are considered fragile glass formers, with ortho-ter-phenyl\tocheck being the canonical example. It is important to note that there is a full continuum of glass formers between the strong and fragile cases.

\begin{figure}
    \todofigure{Plot of strong and fragile liquids}
    \caption{T scaled arrhenius representation, straight line represent arrhenius behaviour}
    \label{fig:angell}
\end{figure}

Fragile glass formers are more interesting in understanding the glass transition because there is a change in the dynamics near the glass transition temperature $T_g$ and therefore there is something more fundamental about the glass transition for these systems. 

As we go to lower and lower temperatures the dynamics of the system slows down dramatically. The relaxation time ($\tau_r$), the time it takes for a liquid to behave like a liquid is proportional to the viscosity. The relaxation time is indicative of the length of time the system needs to sample all thermodynamic states, shorter times will result in a divergence from the thermodynamic equilibrium.

\section{Molecular Crystals}

With the great diversity in molecular shape and structure one might expect that the same could be said of molecular crystals, however five space groups make up \SI{75}{\percent} of all known structures~\cite{brock:94}. This is at odds with the inorganic crystals which occupy a wide range of space groups.

\subsection{Space Groups}

Space groups are a series of rotations, reflections, improper rotations, screw axes and glide planes that completely describe the unit cell of a crystal given the position and orientation of a single molecule within that unit cell. In three dimensional space there are 219 distinct groups (230 including chiral copies) made from combining the 32 crystallographic point groups with the 14 Bravais lattices with the 7 lattice systems. If we are only concerned with two dimensional space then there are only 17 {\em wallpaper} groups.

The space group that a crystal occupies tells us about the level of symmetry in the crystal lattice. The top five space groups for molecular crystals all have low numbers of symmetry elements.

\subsection{Structure}

The optimal packing of hard shapes has been a problem studied extensively throughout history, from circle packings studied by the ancient Greeks, to the packing of spheres studied by Kepler to more recently the packings of more complicated and unusual shapes~\cite{atkinson:12,torquato:12}. These problems of packing hard shapes however are incredibly difficult to solve analytically. The hexagonal close packing~\figref{fig:hcp} was first proposed as the most efficient packing of space in 1611~\cite{kepler:1611}, 400 years later Thomas Hales published the first proof~\cite{hales:05,hales:14} relying heavily on computers to check all possible arrangements in space. While a formal proof of an optimal packing is difficult there are a number of computational methods that are commonly used in an attempt to find the global minimum of a function.

\begin{figure}
    \todofigure{Close packings of a variety of shapes}
    \caption{We have the closest known packed structure for a number of shapes}
    \label{fig:hcp}
\end{figure}

\towrite{Finding global minimum, techniques}

The reason we are interested in the closest packed structure is that is a typical picture of a molecular crystal~\cite{kitaigorodskii:73}. This approach assumes the atoms behave in a manner similar to hard spheres from which molecular shapes can be constructed. The densest packing can the be found utilising one of a number of methods that search the configuration space. 

This method is suitably effective in inorganic chemistry~\cite{wells:84} however there are many organic crystals with a MCN = 14 which is not predicted using this model.

One of the descriptions of the efficacy close packed crystal structure is the Molecular Coordination Number (MCN). This is very similar to the concept of coordination number in inorganic crystals however the generally much weaker interparticle interactions in molecules over ions introduce some nuances.

The typical picture of a molecular crystal is of a close packed structure~\cite{kitaigorodskii:73} where the crystal is arranged such that it occupies as much space as possible. This approach assumes the atoms behave in a manner similar to hard spheres from which molecular shapes can be constructed. The densest packing can the be found utilising one of a number of methods that search the configuration space. This method is suitably effective in inorganic chemistry~\cite{wells:84} however there are many organic crystals with a MCN = 14 which is not predicted using this model.

An alternate method for describing molecular crystals is based on the model of thinnest space covering~\cite{blatov:95} where the entire space is filled with Voroni-Dirichlet polyhedra. These polyhedra are formed by overlapping the atomic spheres until in such a way that they fill the entire space with minimum overlap. The vertexes of the polyhedra correspond to the intersections of the spheres and give information about the interatomic interactions of the molecule. The MCN of these convex polyhedra is the number of faces and the size of the face is proportional to the strength of the interaction. This description of molecular packing is based on the idea of soft deformable atoms and has been shown to be a better description of many molecular crystals~\cite{blatov:97,peresypkina:99,peresypkina:00}

\subsection{Crystal Growth Kinetics}

There are two factors that control the rate of crystallisation~\cite{turnbull:69,ediger:08} depending on the degree of supercooling~\figref{fig:crys growth}. At small supercoolings (\si{0.95 to 1}{$T_m$}) the limiting factor to the growth of the crystal is the spontaneous nucleation. The surface instabilities override the lower enthalpy of the crystal nuclei. While at larger supercoolings (\si{< 0.9}{$T_m$) the limiting factor is now the growth of the crystal front, the growth is under kinetic control. There is some supercooling at which results in the fastest time for a volume fraction to crystallise~\cite{uhlmann:72}.

\begin{figure}
    \todofigure{growth rate of crystals at various supercoolings}
    \caption{Growth rate as a function of supercooling}
    \label{fig:crys growth}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \todofigure{Time temperature transformation curve}
\end{figure}

While there is kinetic control in the overall growth of the crystal, there is also kinetic control at each face. Favourable faces will promote the formation of steps, with each step containing kinks~\figref{fig:steps}. Molecules are more likely to remain attached at these locations since there are more crystalline neighbours~\cite{chernov:61}.

\begin{figure}
    \todofigure{Showing formation of steps and kinks}
    \caption{Shows the formation of steps and kinks and how they promote crystal growth}
    \label{fig:steps}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Recalescence - latent heat of crystallisation, results in single nucleation site.~\cite{turnbull:69} Most effective seed first, afterwards temperature increases preventing any further nucleation (any other seed is worse, since it hadn't already formed a crystal)

    \item Control of growth~\cite{de-yoreo:03}

    \item The crystal growth a large supercoolings is dependent on the fragility of the liquid~\cite{ediger:08}. This is in the region where the crystal growth is limited by diffusion. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nucleation}

\begin{itemize}

    \item Requires passage over a free energy barrier. The free energy per molecule of a crystal phase is only lower than the liquid in the bulk phase; the surface is less well bound. There is such a size where the free energy of a system will decrease whether the nucleus grows or dissolves, a transition state/saddle point.

    \item Nucleation can be controlled by manipulating the surface energy of the nucleus.~\cite{de-yoreo:03}
 
    \item Rate limiting step, needs to be supercooled

\end{itemize}

\section{Glasses}

The glassy state is present in materials with all bond types, covalent, van der Waals, ionic, metallic and hydrogen~\cite{turnbull:69} however there is still no complete theory of the formation of its formation. Unlike the transition from a liquid to a solid, there is no thermodynamic phase transition when forming a glass~\cite{santen:00}, rather we see dynamic arrest. Since there is no transition to form a glassy phase the glass transition temperature $T_g$ is defined as the temperature at which the viscosity of the liquid reaches \SI{e13}{\poise}. This is a somewhat arbitrary point essentially related to how long we are willing to undertake an experiment, however fragile liquids at least exhibit interesting effects near $T_g$.

\begin{itemize}

    \item Have a number of useful properties~\cite{greer:07}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Structure}
\begin{itemize}

    \item The structure of the glass is somewhat dependent on how it was constructed, the rate of cooling, although only by a small amount

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item It has been postulated~\tocite that the glassy phase forms to avoid the Kauzmann paradox. 

    \item Kinetically favoured product
    \item Rate of change of volume or enthalpy with respect to temperature is on par with that of a solid
    \item Ideal glass - lowest energy non-crystalline phase

    \item The most favourable conditions for glass formation involve a large viscosity at the melting point and a rapidly rising viscosity below the melting point.~\cite{uhlmann:72}



    \item The value of the maximum crystal growth rate might be correlated with glass forming ability~\cite{tang:13}

    \item Little difference between activation energies in poor vs strong glass formers~\cite{tang:13}

    \item Locally ordered clusters key to formation~\cite{yang:12} Higher local packing efficiency - lower energy. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Energy Landscape}
One way of understanding the behaviours system is using a multidimensional topographic map, with a dimension for each degree of freedom of each particle. The minima of this topology correspond to regions where there is little net force on each particle, they are also known as inherent structures. With enough energy the system can sample all configurations, this corresponds to the liquid phase. Reducing the energy we begin to limit the configurations the system can sample. If this occurs slowly enough the system will find the lowest energy state, the crystal. However if the energy drops below that of the transition state to the crystal, then the best the system can do is to form a glass~\cite{stillinger:95}. 

\begin{figure}
    \todofigure{2D energy landscape}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ideal glass is lowest energy non-crystalline state.
    \item Fragile glass formers have two types of relaxations, dual scale topology. $\alpha$ relaxations large wells, $\beta$ relaxations small wells.~\cite{stillinger:95}
\end{itemize}


\section{Project Goals}

The goal of my project is to explore fundamental features of molecular shape; asymmetry and concavity, influence the properties of the various condensed phases; liquid, crystal, glass and supercooled-liquid. This requires the characterisation of a new set of molecular models for computer simulation. I will be addressing how the molecular orientation and transition motion couple during crystal growth, how the degree of concavity in the molecular shape determines the dynamics of rotations and translations in the low temperature liquid phase and, to find stable structures that determine the properties of crystals and glasses and how these structures are influenced by molecular shape.
