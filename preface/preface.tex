\prefacesection{Abstract}

Compared to metals, molecules are very slow to crystallise, with no clear understanding as to why this is the case. One property characteristic of a molecule is its shape. We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the role of molecular shape on the dynamic and structural properties of liquids and crystals. We find that small changes to the shape of a molecule can result in order of magnitude changes in the diffusion constant, and rotational and structural relaxation times. These large differences in dynamics can be accounted for by the local rigidity of the liquid state. We also show that even simple molecules can have complex stable crystal forms. Our simulations reproduce the extremely slow crystallisation rates observed experimentally for other molecules. We find that the additional entropy in rotational motion stabilises the liquid phase and lowers the melting point to a region of slow dynamics. We demonstrate that the slow crystallisation rates of our molecules are a direct result of this slow dynamics, and show that relative to the structural relaxation time of the liquid, crystallisation is actually fast.

I would like to thank my advisors, Peter and Asaph for their guidance and support throughout this thesis. Their advice has been invaluble in getting me to this point.

I would also like to thank my family for putting up with me during this year, especially in the last weeks of this project.
